## General info

This repository holds my codes from a course called "Programming and numerical analysis" which I took on my 2nd term of 2nd year of Physics studies at University of Warsaw.
Because of COVID-19 outbreak, we were obliged to take most of the classes online, however some of the classes (and because of that, topics) doubled. That is why there are 
two seperate folders, Exercises_from_classes and Exercises_from_webpage, where the Exercises_from_classes is the one that is supposed to be the "main path" of the course
and Exercises_from_webpage being the filler arc. However useful, I suggest to stick to topics from Exercises_from_classes as they cover most of the most popular topics in this field.


## Topics

Exercises_from_webpage covers:
* week2
  * biggest/smallest from provided
  * primes and primorials
  * GCD, digits, hailstone
* week 4
  * min/max
  * memcpy
  * egyptian fractions
  * binary search
  * arrays and vectors operations
* week 6
  * Neville's algorithm

whereas Exercises_from_classes covers:
* week2
  * primes, powers
  * binaries to decimals
  * approximating sine function's value
  * summing number's digits values
  * pseudo-random number guessing "game"

## Further reading

Besides course's script and Wikipedia pages there were some sources that got essential over the course, which are:

* R. Sedgewick "Algorithms in C++"
* H. Keller "Analysis of numerical methods"
* R. K. Gupta "Numerical methods: Fundamentals and Applications"

One probably could get past the course without any external sources, however those make things much easier, clearer and most importantly - interesting.
